# Broken App Issues

1. Input Validation Missing/Security
   - The code doesn't check if the 'developers' array is present or is a valid array in the request body. This could lead to a security vulnerability.

2. Error Handling
   - The error handling in the catch block might not be effective. Logging errors or sending appropriate error responses to the client would be better for debugging in the future.

3. Rate Limiting
   - GitHub has rate limits; exceeding them may lead to issues.
   - Should try to implement rate limiting/handle rate limit errors
